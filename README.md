# hello_world_python

The goal is to create a small container with a controlled python environment
that will help us print out, 'Hello World' to the console.

# Building the containers

After opening the project in vs code within the development container,
run the build task. That will create the `abd/devexp/proddeploy:1.0` container
in the local docker repo.

# Running the command

`docker run abd/devexp/proddeploy:1.0`
